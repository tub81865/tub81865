  <!-- Intro / Overview -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this course was to learn how to solve real-world problems in a GIS framework.
      This final portfolio highlights three of my strongest maps from the semester and shows what I am
      now capable of doing with GIS tools, spatial analysis, and cartographic design.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each map, I identify the problem I was trying to solve, explain how GIS helped answer it,
      and list the specific tools and workflows I used. Together, these examples represent my “bright
      spots” from 15 weeks of GIS training.

  <!-- MAP 1: FLINT -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Map 1 – Flint, Michigan: At-Risk Water Contamination Zones</h2>

    <!-- When you upload the image, update the src="flint-map.png" to match the exact file name -->
    <img class="map" src="flint-map.png" alt="Map of at-risk water contamination zones in Flint, Michigan" />

    <h3>Narrative</h3>
    <p>
      This map identifies the neighborhoods in Flint, Michigan that face the highest combined risk of contaminated drinking water.
      I focused on locations that met three simultaneous criteria: proximity to TRI facilities releasing over 10,000 tons of water pollutants,
      closeness to major rivers, and residential areas served by lead-based service lines. By buffering each risk factor and intersecting
      them, I isolated the exact zones where environmental hazards converge and residents are most vulnerable. The results revealed
      a concentrated hotspot near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Park, where industrial pollution, river flow, and aging lead infrastructure
      overlap. This spatial analysis demonstrates how GIS can expose hidden environmental injustices that would be difficult to understand
      from raw data alone. The map ultimately shows where the threat is most severe and why these areas demand priority attention.
    </p>

    <h3>GIS Tools and Skills Used</h3>
    <ul class="skills-list">
      <li><strong>Buffer &amp; Dissolve:</strong> Created 1,584-ft buffers for TRI facilities and rivers, and 1,056-ft buffers for lead service lines; dissolved overlaps for clean polygons.</li>
      <li><strong>Joins &amp; Attribute Query:</strong> Joined TRI pollutant data to identify facilities exceeding 10,000 tons of water pollution and selected only “Lead Only” service lines.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlay Analysis:</strong> Intersected all three risk layers to locate the exact spatial overlap of hazards.</li>
      <li><strong>Clip:</strong> Limited the final intersected layer to the City of Flint boundary for accurate municipal context.</li>
      <li><strong>Calculate Geometry:</strong> Identified the highest-risk area (near Vietnam Veterans Memorial Park) from the final intersected polygons.</li>
      <li><strong>Cartographic Design:</strong> Applied clear symbology, transparency, color contrast, a hazard “grave” icon, legend, scale bar, north arrow, and used the NAD_1983_HARN_StatePlane_Michigan_South_FIPS_2113_Feet_Intl projection.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Map 2 – [Title of Your Second Map]</h2>

    <!-- Replace this with your second map image -->
    <img class="map" src="map2.png" alt="Second GIS map" />

    <h3>Narrative</h3>
    <p>
      [Write a 4–6 sentence narrative here describing the problem this map addresses,
      the key data you used, and what spatial patterns or insights the map reveals.
      Make sure to say what question you were trying to answer and how the map helps
      answer it.]
    </p>

    <h3>GIS Tools and Skills Used</h3>
    <ul class="skills-list">
      <li>[List the main tools: e.g., spatial joins, select by location, reclassification, etc.]</li>
      <li>[Mention any projections or coordinate systems you had to manage.]</li>
      <li>[Explain any cartographic choices you made to focus the reader’s attention.]</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Map 3 – [Title of Your Third Map]</h2>

    <!-- Replace this with your third map image -->
    <img class="map" src="map3.png" alt="Third GIS map" />

    <h3>Narrative</h3>
    <p>
      [Write a 4–6 sentence narrative here for your third map. Again, clearly
      identify the problem, the data, and the main finding. Connect the map to a real-world
      question or decision where possible.]
    </p>

    <h3>GIS Tools and Skills Used</h3>
    <ul class="skills-list">
      <li>[List the key geoprocessing tools used for this map.]</li>
      <li>[Include any overlay, buffering, or network analysis steps you performed.]</li>
      <li>[Mention design choices that support visual hierarchy and readability.]</li>
