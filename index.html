  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This course taught me how to use GIS as a full problem-solving framework rather than just a mapping tool.
    Each assignment pushed me to take a real-world issue, break it into measurable spatial components, and
    determine <em>“where the location is just right,”</em> in geography as always being central to the question. The Chimero reading reinforced this mindset by reminding us
    to consider not only <strong>how</strong> we build something, but <strong>why</strong> it matters — why spatial
    patterns appear, why the insights are meaningful, and why GIS is the appropriate lens to reveal them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over fifteen weeks, I learned how to combine datasets, construct buffers, run overlay analysis, perform
    joins, calculate densities, and design clear visualizations that communicate meaning rather than noise.
    More importantly, I learned how spatial relationships expose inequalities, environmental risks, and social
    patterns that raw tables or narrative descriptions cannot reveal. The work became less about making maps
    and more about using geographic evidence to understand the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    This portfolio highlights three of my strongest projects from the semester. Each one focuses on a different
    problem — environmental health in Flint, environmental justice in Los Angeles, and crime/tourism dynamics in
    Chicago — but the workflow is the same: define the question, identify the spatial criteria, select the right
    GIS tools, and create visuals that tell a clear and compelling story. Together, these maps show both what I
    accomplished this semester and what I am now capable of doing within a GIS framework.

  <!-- MAP 1: FLINT -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Map 1 – Flint, Michigan: At-Risk Water Contamination Zones</h2>

    <!-- When you upload the image, update the src="flint-map.png" to match the exact file name -->
    <img class="map" src="flint-map.png" alt="Map of at-risk water contamination zones in Flint, Michigan" />

    <h3>Identifying Where Lead Infrastructure, Industrial Pollution, and River Exposure Overlap</h3>
    <p>
      This map identifies the neighborhoods in Flint, Michigan that face the highest combined risk of contaminated drinking water.
      I focused on locations that met three simultaneous criteria: proximity to TRI facilities releasing over 10,000 tons of water pollutants,
      closeness to major rivers, and residential areas served by lead-based service lines. By buffering each risk factor and intersecting
      them, I isolated the exact zones where environmental hazards converge and residents are most vulnerable. The results revealed
      a concentrated hotspot near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Park, where industrial pollution, river flow, and aging lead infrastructure
      overlap. This spatial analysis demonstrates how GIS can expose hidden environmental injustices that would be difficult to understand
      from raw data alone. The map ultimately shows where the threat is most severe and why these areas demand priority attention.
    </p>

    <h3>GIS Tools and Skills Used</h3>
    <ul class="skills-list">
      <li><strong>Buffer &amp; Dissolve:</strong> Created 1,584-ft buffers for TRI facilities and rivers, and 1,056-ft buffers for lead service lines; dissolved overlaps for clean polygons.</li>
      <li><strong>Joins &amp; Attribute Query:</strong> Joined TRI pollutant data to identify facilities exceeding 10,000 tons of water pollution and selected only “Lead Only” service lines.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlay Analysis:</strong> Intersected all three risk layers to locate the exact spatial overlap of hazards.</li>
      <li><strong>Clip:</strong> Limited the final intersected layer to the City of Flint boundary for accurate municipal context.</li>
      <li><strong>Calculate Geometry:</strong> Identified the highest-risk area (near Vietnam Veterans Memorial Park) from the final intersected polygons.</li>
      <li><strong>Cartographic Design:</strong> Applied clear symbology, transparency, color contrast, a hazard “grave” icon, legend, scale bar, north arrow, and used the NAD_1983_HARN_StatePlane_Michigan_South_FIPS_2113_Feet_Intl projection.</li>

  <!-- MAP 2: PLACEHOLDER -->
  <section class="section">
      <!-- MAP 2: LOS ANGELES -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Map 2 – Los Angeles: Schools, Landfills, and Income Inequality</h2>

    <!-- Export your LA landfill/schools map as map2.png and upload it to this repo -->
    <img class="map" src="map2.png" alt="Map of low-income census tracts in Los Angeles with schools near landfills" />

    <h3>Determining Whether Low-Income Communities Face Greater Exposure to Methane-Producing Landfills</h3>
    <p>
      This map analyzes whether lower-income neighborhoods in Los Angeles are more likely to have schools located near methane-producing landfills.
      Using census income data, landfill polygons, and school locations, I identified schools that fall within 0.5 km of any landfill and then isolated
      those inside census tracts in the bottom 50% of income per capita. The results show that many of these high-risk schools are concentrated in
      Supervisorial District&nbsp;1, reinforcing long-standing environmental justice concerns. This pattern suggests that economically disadvantaged
      communities are disproportionately exposed to methane-related health risks compared to wealthier districts, even though rare outliers like Bel Air
      also appear in the data. Overall, the map demonstrates how GIS can reveal inequities that would otherwise remain hidden and provides a foundation
      for more just environmental policy.
    </p>

    <h3>GIS Tools and Skills Used</h3>
    <ul class="skills-list">
      <li><strong>Select by Location:</strong> Found all schools within 0.5 km of landfill polygons.</li>
      <li><strong>Attribute Sorting &amp; Selection:</strong> Ranked census tracts by income per capita and selected the bottom 50% to isolate low-income communities.</li>
      <li><strong>Spatial Intersection:</strong> Linked selected schools to their underlying census tracts and identified clusters in Supervisorial District&nbsp;1.</li>
      <li><strong>Export &amp; Layer Management:</strong> Saved the final selection as a clean layer (<em>LowIncome_Tracts_near_Landfills</em>) for mapping and analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Contextual Comparison:</strong> Identified Bel Air as the wealthiest tract with a nearby landfill, highlighting outliers in the overall pattern.</li>
      <li><strong>Cartographic Design:</strong> Used clear symbology, labeling, and visual hierarchy to emphasize low-income tracts containing at-risk schools.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- MAP 3: CHICAGO -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Map 3 – Chicago: Homicide Density and Airbnb Activity</h2>

    <!-- Export your Chicago homicide/Airbnb map as map3.png and upload it to this repo -->
    <img class="map" src="map3.png" alt="Map of homicide density and Airbnb activity by police district in Chicago" />

    <h3>Analyzing How Violent Crime Patterns Compare to Airbnb Density and Tourism Hotspot</h3>
    <p>
      This map examines the relationship between homicide density and tourism activity across Chicago's police districts.
      After projecting all layers to NAD 1983 / UTM Zone 16N, I summarized homicides per district and compared those patterns
      to Airbnb review density and average Airbnb price. The spatial distribution shows a clear divide: south and west districts
      experience the highest homicide densities, while downtown and northern districts have the strongest Airbnb activity and
      highest lodging prices. These results contradict the oversimplified narrative that Chicago's crime problem is uniform across
      the city and instead reveal a highly uneven risk landscape. The analysis demonstrates how GIS can transform raw crime and
      business data into nuanced insight for public communication, tourism planning, and policy decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>GIS Tools and Skills Used</h3>
    <ul class="skills-list">
      <li><strong>Projection Management:</strong> Reprojected crime, police district, and Airbnb layers to NAD&nbsp;1983 / UTM Zone 16N for consistent analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Select by Attributes:</strong> Filtered the crime dataset to include only homicides before summarizing patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Spatial Join:</strong> Counted homicides per police district and aggregated Airbnb reviews and prices to the district level.</li>
      <li><strong>Field Calculation:</strong> Added an area (sq mi) field and computed homicide and Airbnb review densities.</li>
      <li><strong>Summary Statistics:</strong> Calculated total reviews and average Airbnb price by district to support comparison with homicide density.</li>
      <li><strong>Thematic Mapping &amp; Layout Design:</strong> Built graduated color choropleths for homicide and Airbnb density, created an average-price chart,
        and exported high-quality layouts with legends, north arrows, scale bars, and consistent fonts.</li>
    </ul>
